      How we play
    summary: >-
      Before P&L and companies like us existed, <span class="standard">broadcast content</span> was divided into short-form<br/>
      ( commercials ), digital ( social, we ) and long-form content ( films, docs etc. ) as they <br/><span class="bold">r e q u i r e</span> different brands <span class="cursive-font bold normal-case">Of</span> storytelling.<br/><br/>
      <span class="cursive-font bold normal-case">But</span> now that we are living in a more ‘media fluid’ world, the definition of a <span class="bold">c o m m e r c i a l</span> and where it may appear has <span class="standard">changed radically</span>.<br/><br/>

      The advertisers of today need production partners that are equally fluid and capable of creating engaging content in multiple arenas.
