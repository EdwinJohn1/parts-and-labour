## Introduction

The <b>Parts & Labour</b> website is built with the Gatsby.js frontend framework and is deployed via Netlify. It sources static images from a GCP bucket and video files from Akamai.

## ðŸš€ Get started

This project uses Node v18.12.1. You can automatically set your local Node version using NVM by executing `nvm use` in your terminal.

1.  **Install dependencies**

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Configure local .env file**

    The site requires a .env file populated with specific environment variables in order to source the static images from GCP. Copy/pasge the `.env.sample` file (rename to `.env`) and contact an administrator to fill in the proper values. **Do not fill out and commit the values in .env.sample**.

3.  **Run the project locally**

    ```shell
    npm run start
    ```

    The site is configured to run at at http://localhost:8000 unless otherwise specified.

## Deployments

Deploying the project is as simple as committing your code to Github. Netlify is configured to deploy production builds from the `master` branch here:

```
https://lighthearted-alfajores-12bc44.netlify.app
https://partsandlabour.com
```

Changes committed to the `develop` branch can be previewed here:

`https://develop--lighthearted-alfajores-12bc44.netlify.app/`

You can also create a branch preview by creating a Pull Request for your branch against the `master` branch. [More info here](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/deploy-previews/).

It is highly recommended that nothing is merged into the master branch until it's been previewed, QA'd and vetted on a preview branch.

## Data

All app data is configured in the `src/data` directory and queried using Gatsby's Graphql API.
